It protects the tissue that lines your lungs, throat, and nasal and sinus passages, keeping it from drying out. It also works to trap unwanted bacteria and allergens (such as dust or pollen), preventing them from spreading through your body and making you sick. Mucus even contains antibodies, or enzymes, designed to kill or neutralize these harmful materials. The body usually produces as much as 1.5 liters of mucus a day, even when you're not feeling sick.
Muscle Health: Muscle is the tissue of the body which primarily functions as a source of power. Muscles are mostly made up of proteins.

Neurodepressive: Neurodepressive refers to a food or medicine which depresses nerve-cell function.
Neurogenesis: Neurogenesis is the process by which new nervous system cells, known as neurons, are produced by neural stem cells (NSC)s in the brain. During the process, neural stem cells differentiate—that is, they become any one of a number of specialised cell types—at specific times and regions in the brain.
Neuroprotective: (Neuroprotection) Neuroprotective refers to an item's ability to protect and preserve neuronal structure and/or function against damage, degeneration, or impairment. In the case of an ongoing insult (a neurodegenerative insult) the relative preservation of neuronal integrity implies a reduction in the rate of neuronal loss over time.
Neurotoxicity: Neurotoxicity is a form of toxicity in which a biological, chemical, or physical agent produces an adverse effect on the structure or function of the central and/or peripheral nervous system.
Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the build up of extra fat in liver cells that is not caused by alcohol. Risk factors include obesity, gastric bypass surgery, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. Most people have no symptoms. In rare cases, people may experience fatigue, pain, or weight loss. Over time, inflammation and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) can occur.

Prostate Cancer: Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. A man's prostate is a small walnut-sized gland that produces seminal fluid and nourishes & transports the sperm. Prostate cancer usually grows slowly and is initially confined to the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm. However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly.
Prostate Health: The following items have demonstrated properties which contribute to prostate health.
Relaxation: Relaxation refers to the state of being free from tension and anxiety.
Renal Failure: Renal failure refers to when the kidneys stop working. When your kidneys fail, it means they have stopped working well enough for you to survive without dialysis. Acute renal failure is sudden and often only temporary loss of kidney function. Chronic renal failure, also called end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is the last stage of chronic kidney disease which usually requires a transplant. 
Renal Interstitial Fibrosis: Kidney interstitial fibrosis (IF) can be defined as the accumulation of collagen and related molecules in the interstitial extracellular matrix (a contiguous fluid-filled space between internal structures within the kidneys).
Repetitive Stress Injuries:
Reproductive Health: Reproductive health, or sexual health addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.
Respiratory Infections: Respiratory Infection is defined as any infectious disease of the upper or lower respiratory tract.
Retinal Toxicity: Retinal toxicity refers to toxicity of the retina in the eyes. Toxic effects on the retina are seen in the macula. While early toxicity may be asymtomatic, patients with more advanced stage of toxicity may complain of color vision changes or paracentral scotomas.
Retinopathy: Retinopathy is a disease of the retina which results in impairment or loss of vision.
Sexual Function: Sexual function is how the body reacts in different stages of the sexual response cycle.
Skin Health: Skin health refers to items that support skin integrity, enhance its appearance and relieve skin conditions.
Skin Hydration: Skin hydration refers to increasing the water content of your skin cells.
Skin Inflammation: Skin Inflammation (Inflammatory skin disease) can be classified as acute or chronic. Acute inflammation results from such things as exposure to UV radiation (UVR), allergens, or chemicals. If inflammation is long lasting it can cause significant and serious tissue damage.

Sunburn: Sunburn refers to a type of skin burn resulting from too much exposure to sunlight or sunlamps.
Testosterone: Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In male humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair.
Toxoplasmosis: Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Infections with toxoplasmosis usually cause no obvious symptoms in adults. Occasionally, people may have a few weeks or months of mild, flu-like illness such as muscle aches and tender lymph nodes. In a small number of people, eye problems may develop.
Ulcerative Colitis: Ulcerative Colitis is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation in the digestive tract. Having ulcerative colitis puts a patient at increased risk of developing colon cancer.
Ulcers: An ulcer is an open sore on an external or internal surface of the body, caused by a break in the skin or mucous membrane that fails to heal.

UTI: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), also called bladder infection, is an infection in any part of the urinary system, the kidneys, bladder, or urethra.
UV Skin Damage: UltraViolet radiation (UV) has properties of both a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter. Excessive exposure to UV carries profound health risks, including atrophy, pigmentary changes, wrinkling and malignancy. UV is epidemiologically and molecularly linked to the three most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Genetic factors also influence risk of UV-mediated skin disease.
Vascular Function: The vascular system, also called the circulatory system, is made up of the vessels that carry blood and lymph through the body. The arteries and veins carry blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body tissues and taking away tissue waste matter.
