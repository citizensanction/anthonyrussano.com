## Work History

I began working as a Software Test Engineer directly after high school. I was also going to schoool part-time to study computer science.

I got to work under the tutalage of great engineers and executives who helped me learn valuable career skills related to web development, business management, and technology as a whole.

I served as Network/ Systems Administrator at the University of California, San Diego: Extended Studies and Learning Campus.  I was responsible for maintaining a very large network of computers and equipment split between multiple locations.  The users I was responsible for included: students, faculty, teachers/staff, and programmers.  I had a team of about 3 part-time students and 2-3 staff members at my disposal.  They helped provide support to students and teachers.  I worked with the department director (my boss) to provide direct support to the application developers and other department heads.  Overall it was a great learning experience and I succeeded in completing my assignment.

My most exciting role was as an independent contractor, where I helped launch multiple businesses.  I was directly responsible in helping to launch four seperate insurance agencies.  I started out partnering with my uncle to launch his first allstate agency.  Then, after a year I helped another fledgling agency get off the ground.  I proceeded to foster the successful merger of those two agencies.  Then I went on to help a 3rd agency owner launch his business. I then graduated to helping a Farmers Agent transition his captive agency into an independent brokerage.  In all cases, I was the key man in charge of business development, sales, account management, marketing, and infrastructure.

I was very successfull and highly sought after in the insurance field. However, I became interested in learning the housing market, and I was spontaneously recruited to work for a morgage lender.

I recently got back into the IT field, by taking a job as a dispatcher for a national IT firm. In this position I learned a lot about how managed service providers work.
