# Natural Healing Search

https://www.naturalhealingsearch.com

Anthony Russano created NaturalHealingSearch.com a number of years ago.  The site was originally named AlchemistCookbook.com

NaturalHealingSearch.com is a continually updated encyclopedia of more than 200 of natural healing items.  The site includes an alphabetical list of articles, a keyword glossary and cross index of terms, as well as a full-text search feature, all for free without any registration process.

The focus of the Natural Healing Search is to curate cutting-edge research papaers published by respected, peer-review science journals and present the data in a meaningful way for end users to sift through.
